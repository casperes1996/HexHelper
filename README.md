# HexHelper
A tool for quickly converting hex, decimal, octal and binary

Note that this tool was semi-hastily put together for personal use. You may use, modify and do whatever you want with it - literally anything - but the code isn't of the highest quality in the world right now, and Xcode 12 didn't want to run Unit Tests, so there are no tests.
Cheers
